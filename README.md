A simple note taking app built using Next JS, Firestore, Firebase Auth and Tailwind CSS. The app demonstrates how to 
- authenticate the user using Firebase Auth (using Google account)
- verify user authentication on server side
- pre render the page that displays user related data on server side
- perform CRUD operations on the data stored on Firestore
- refetch data from server side once user makes some changes (POST, PUT) to the existing data
